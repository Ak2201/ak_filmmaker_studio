# The Filmmaker's Studio — working notes

Read this before changing anything. It is short on purpose; the parts that look
like fussy rules is there because breaking it has already cost a user their work
or silently broken a page.

## What this is

Four browser-based tools for filmmakers — a hub, two step-by-step blueprints,
and a reference library. Local-first: everything a user writes lives in their
browser's `localStorage`. Optional Supabase sync on top. Static build, no server.

It is a **writing tool people keep months of work in.** That single fact decides
most arguments: correctness of stored data beats every other consideration.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # vite dev server, no service worker
npm run build     # static output in dist/
npm run preview   # serve the build (exercises the real service worker)
npm run verify    # ← the important one, see below
npm run density   # design-density report; measures, asserts nothing
npm run extract   # regenerate src/data/*.json from legacy/ and self-check
npm run icons     # regenerate PWA icons from tokens.css
```

`VITE_DISABLE_SW=1 npm run build` builds without registering a service worker —
for hosted previews that shouldn't outlive themselves in a cache.

```

## Hard invariants

**1. Storage keys are a contract with real users' saved work.**
Every `data-key` string, and every `localStorage` key, is load-bearing. A user
who has filled in 24 steps has a blob keyed by those exact strings. Renaming one
without a migration silently orphans their writing. Do not "tidy" them.

The `arunak_` prefix is historical and should eventually go — but only as one
deliberate pass with a migration that moves existing data. Not opportunistically.

**2. Content lives in `src/data/*.json`, not in markup.**
The 24 feature steps used to exist in three places (the markup, the jump
dropdown, and `exportMarkdown()`) with nothing keeping them in step. Now the
jump menu, search index, master index and Markdown export all derive from the
same file. If you find yourself hand-writing a list of steps or films, stop —
derive it.

To change copy, edit the JSON. To change how copy is presented, edit
`src/ui/steps.js` or the stylesheets.

**3. `legacy/` is history, not the oracle.** The four original hand-written
pages. `npm run extract` still reads them to regenerate `src/data`, so they must
not be edited — but they are no longer what `npm run verify` diffs against.

They were the oracle through the migration and they earned it: they proved the
rebuild lost no `data-key` and no prose. Then they became a ceiling. Pinning the
app to 2023 markup meant every deliberate redesign had to be bought with
`EXPECTED` entries until the allowlist was the document and the check was noise.

`scripts/baseline.json` replaces them — see section 04. The first baseline was
captured from commit `16bf3b4`, which still passed 100% accounted coverage
against `legacy/`, so the original guarantee is inherited rather than discarded.
The file records the commit it came from.

Three of the four `legacy/` files also differ from `origin/main`: during the
migration the trap fixes below were applied to them so the two sides could be
compared like for like. Every one of those edits is inside a `<script>` block,
which the extractor strips, so they never affected verification.

**4. Colours, sizes and spacing come from `src/styles/tokens.css`.**
Every colour is a token. This rule previously claimed there were zero raw
colours outside that file; there were nine, and a claim nobody can verify stops
being enforceable. The real position, with the two intended exceptions:

- `src/styles/chrome-injected.css` — nine colour declarations (three hex, six
  `rgba()`). It is a verbatim port of the style string `studio-store.js` used to
  inject at runtime. The chrome surface is dark in *every* theme while
  `--danger` is not, so substituting tokens naively would cut contrast in paper.
  It wants a considered pass, not a find-and-replace.
- The palette picker's seed colours — `palette_c1..c3` in `src/pages/feature.js`
  and the matching swatches in `steps.feature.json`. `<input type="color">`
  requires a hex literal and these are the user's editable starting values.
  They are content, not design tokens. Leave them.

Anything else is a bug. To check:

```bash
grep -rnE '#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}\b|rgba?\([0-9]' src --include=*.css --include=*.js | grep -v tokens.css
```

No `body.dark` rules: paper / sepia / ink are token swaps, and a rule that only
exists to restate a colour for dark mode is a bug. Tokens are declared in bare
`:root` first, then overridden under `prefers-color-scheme` and `[data-theme]` —
and the JS half has to hold up its end, which it did not for a while. See the
theme trap below.

**7. Shapes come from the skin, not from the rule that draws them.**
`src/styles/modules.css` is the design language every page reads. Nothing in it
hard-codes a radius, a padding, a border width, a display size or an italic:
each is a `--sk-*` variable, and a *skin* is one file in `src/styles/skins/`
that sets them. `skins/_contract.css` lists the variables and the four rules a
skin follows; `studio` is the default, `press` is the printed-matter look this
replaced, `binder` is flat and dense.

This is what makes the design swappable rather than merely changed, and it is
cheap to break: one `border-radius: 4px` typed into a rule is a shape one skin
can never override. Two things keep it honest —

- a skin is discovered, never registered. `skin.js` globs the directory and
  reads the picker back out of the CSSOM, so dropping a file in is the whole
  installation. The same reason the steps live in JSON: a hand-written list of
  what exists is wrong by the second change.
- `verify` asserts that every skin file on disk reached the page, that each
  produces a distinct look, and that none of them overflows at 390px.

Theme and skin are orthogonal: theme picks the palette, skin picks the shapes.
All nine combinations have to work, which is why a skin never writes a literal
colour — only `var(--token)`.

**5. No inline `onclick` / `onchange` anywhere.**
A strict CSP ships in `vercel.json`; an inline handler breaks the page under it.
Use `delegate()` from `src/lib/dom.js` with `data-action` attributes. Some `raw`
blocks in `src/data` still carry inline handlers from the original markup; each
page strips and rebinds them at render time (`dehydrateInlineHandlers` /
`adoptInlineHandlers`). If you promote a raw block to a real component, drop the
handler properly rather than moving it.

**6. `src/lib/store.js` must evaluate before anything reads `localStorage`.**
It monkey-patches `Storage.prototype` to namespace keys per project. As a module
this is import-order dependent, not script-tag dependent. Every page entry
imports it first. `chrome.js` and `cloud.js` import it too — those imports look
unused; they are not. Do not prune them.

## The verification workflow

**Run `npm run build && npm run verify` before every commit.** It serves `dist/`,
loads all four pages in Chromium, and diffs each against `scripts/baseline.json`:

- every `data-key` still present (exact — this is the storage contract)
- visible-text coverage, with an explicit allowlist of deliberate wording
  changes in the script. A word that goes missing and is *not* on the list fails
  the run; an allowlist entry that stops firing also fails, so the list can't rot
  into a set of permanent excuses. If you intentionally reword something, add it
  to `EXPECTED` with a reason.
- zero inline handlers
- zero `localStorage` writes during four seconds of idle (see the save loop below)
- zero horizontal overflow at 390px
- zero console errors
- the three themes produce three distinct backgrounds. The stylesheets key off
  `:root[data-theme]`; when `applyTheme()` only set body classes every theme
  rendered identically and nothing above noticed, because the text, the keys and
  the handlers are all still correct on a page with the wrong palette.
- the skins: every file in `src/styles/skins/` reached the page, each produces a
  distinct set of `--sk-*` values, and none overflows at 390px. Three
  assertions rather than one because they fail differently — a skin that stops
  changing anything shows up as a duplicate fingerprint, but a skin whose file
  never loaded produces no duplicate at all, so only the disk-vs-page count
  catches it.
- hue-coded surfaces still distinguish. Where the markup declares a variant
  (`.door.shorts`, `.start-card.f`, `.fest-card.t2`, `.example.alt`) the design
  must render more than one colour, at 3px or wider. This exists because the
  redesign's main move — folding decorative left rules into hairline cards —
  swallowed two groups that were carrying data, and the hub's three blueprints
  came out reading as two. No other check could see it: the keys, the words,
  the handlers and the overflow are all correct on a page whose colour coding
  has collapsed. The check keys off the *variant* rather than asking "do these
  differ?", so a group that is legitimately uniform is not flagged.

Then one studio-level check that is not per page:

- **a backup round trip** — two projects out, two projects back, contents
  matched. `export`/`import` is the only backup a local-first app has, and the
  per-page diff cannot see it: the hub's markup is identical whether the file
  holds every project or just the open one.

Current state: all four pages pass at 100% accounted coverage, and the round
trip restores both projects.

**Re-baselining.** `npm run baseline` recaptures `scripts/baseline.json` from the
current build. It is a deliberate act, not a fix for a failing run — the new
capture becomes the thing every later run is judged against, so a regression
baked in at that moment is invisible forever after. Re-baseline when a redesign
is intentional and the output is known good, and say so in the commit. If
`EXPECTED` is growing, that is the signal to re-baseline rather than to keep
adding rows.

**What the text check can and cannot see.** Coverage compares word *sets*, not
sentences. Deleting a sentence whose every word appears elsewhere on the page
will not trip it — that was equally true of the `legacy/` oracle. The `data-key`
check is the exact one, and it is the one that protects saved work: a renamed
key fails the run immediately.

**Known blind spot.** The run loads each page at 1280px and resizes to 390px
*afterwards*, so anything gated on `matchMedia` at load time has already decided
by then — the mobile action bar never attaches during a verify run and its
layout is untested. Check viewport-gated chrome by hand at 390px.

**Checks that can skip themselves.** The hue-coding assertion reports each
group as passed, failed *or skipped*, because a group that never appears looks
exactly like one that passes if you only print the ones that ran. The
breakdown's chips exist only once a scene does, so the run seeds two scenes on
that page — after the text and key capture, so the empty state is still what
the baseline is compared against. Gating a check on something the bug itself
would remove is the trap here: the first version skipped the breakdown groups
whenever their class names were wrong, which is when they mattered.

## Traps already paid for

These were real bugs. Re-introducing one is easy, so they are named here.

- **The save loop.** `updatePalette()` must never call `debouncedSave()`. It runs
  inside `refreshAll()`, which runs inside `saveData()`. That cycle re-serialised
  all 359 fields and re-rendered four widgets every 400ms forever. The idle-write
  assertion in `verify` exists to catch its return.
- **Escaping order.** `escAttr` must escape `&` *before* `"`. The other order
  turned `&quot;` into `&amp;quot;` on every save, so quote marks in a script grew
  four characters per autosave.
- **`li.value` is a number.** `HTMLLIElement.value` is an ordinal, not a string.
  Assigning a saved boolean to a checklist `<li>` made it `1`, and the next
  `.trim()` threw — one ticked checkbox permanently broke the short-film page on
  every later load. Field scans use
  `input[data-key], textarea[data-key], select[data-key]`; checklist items get
  their own `.step-check li` scan.
- **Unanchored suffix matching.** `parseNum` tests must be anchored (`/(lakh|l)$/`).
  Unanchored, a bare `l` anywhere made "1 lens day" parse as ₹1,00,000.
- **Don't persist the same thing twice.** Scene rows were once written both as
  flat `sm_N_*` keys and inside a `_sceneMap` array; indices renumbered on reload
  and stranded stale keys that inflated the progress denominator forever. One
  representation per thing.
- **An empty array is truthy.** `loadData` checking `if (saved._sceneMap)` gave
  returning users a table with zero rows and no way to add one.
- **Chrome initialises at import time**, when `#app` is still empty. Pages call a
  re-init after render to rebuild the step rail, glossary popovers and aria
  labels. If you add render-dependent chrome, wire it into that re-init.
  `short.js` went a long time without one at all, which is why it had no step
  rail, no reading progress and eighteen unlabelled inputs while the other three
  pages were fine.
- **The storage proxy scopes "studio-wide" operations to the open project.**
  `store.js` patches `getItem`/`setItem`/`removeItem` to suffix every
  `SCOPED_KEYS` entry with the current project id. Anything in `hub.js` that
  reaches for one of those keys through `localStorage` therefore gets *one*
  project, however global its name. Export called itself "full studio backup"
  and contained a single film; reset promised "this erases EVERYTHING" and left
  the other projects on disk. When an operation really is studio-wide, iterate
  `listProjects()` and address each project explicitly through
  `rawGet`/`rawSet`/`rawRemove(key + '__' + id)`, which bypass the proxy.
- **`--hue` is set by a class, and the class has to exist.** Two families
  set it: `.sh-ph-*` maps a phase to its hue for the nav, and `.hue-*` names
  the hue directly for things whose colour is a *category*. `breakdown.js`
  wrote `.sh-ph-feature` and `.sh-ph-library` for its element chips — names in
  neither family, matching no rule — so `--hue` was never defined, the borders
  fell back to `currentColor`, and the page that introduced "colour = the
  category" rendered every category in grey from the day it shipped. Nothing
  noticed for two commits, because a CSS variable that is never defined fails
  silently by design. If you add a hue, add it in `tokens.css` and nowhere
  else.
- **A skin's defaults belong on bare `:root` too.** `studio.css` declares its
  `--sk-*` values on `:root` *and* on `:root[data-skin="studio"]`. Only the
  second looks necessary. The first is what makes the app correct before
  `skin.js` has run and when `localStorage` throws — without it every card on
  the page loses its border and its padding for the length of one paint. Same
  shape of bug as the theme trap below, one level up: the JS sets an attribute
  the CSS keys off, so the CSS has to be right when the JS has not run.
- **Sticky the navigation, not just the page's own bar.** For a while the shell
  (rail + phases) was `position: relative` and the page toolbar was `sticky`.
  Scrolling a 65,000px blueprint therefore discarded the bar that says *where
  you are* and kept the one that says *what you can do here* — the navigation
  layer existed only at the very top of the longest pages in the app. The shell
  is sticky at ≥1100px now and publishes its measured height as `--sh-h` for the
  toolbar to sit under. Below 1100px it still scrolls away on purpose: the two
  bars stack there, and 164px of chrome above a text field on a phone is worse
  than losing the nav. For the same reason `.toolbar` is `position: static`
  below 560px — wrapped to four rows and stuck, it was 391px, 46% of an 844px
  phone, permanently. What you need while typing is the fixed bottom action bar
  and the save indicator; the toolbar is one flick up.
- **The theme lives on `:root[data-theme]`, not on a body class.** `tokens.css`
  matches `[data-theme="light"|"sepia"|"dark"]`; `body.dark` / `body.sepia`
  match nothing. When `applyTheme()` set only the classes, all three themes
  rendered identically, a user who chose paper got ink on a dark-mode OS
  (nothing set `[data-theme="light"]`, so the `prefers-color-scheme` block won),
  and sepia was unreachable. `applyTheme()` stamps the attribute *first* —
  `documentElement` exists before `<body>`, so that also avoids a flash — and
  keeps the classes in the same call, because four pages still read them as
  state. `verify` asserts three distinct backgrounds now.

## How to do common things

**Change a step's wording** → edit `src/data/steps.feature.json` (or `.short`).
Keep `key` values untouched.

**Add a film / rule / director** → append to the JSON. Counts on the cover and in
the section heads derive, so they update themselves.

**Promote a bespoke widget** → `raw` blocks are elements the extractors couldn't
model (`char-map`, `pp-table`, `dept-grid`, …). They are re-inserted verbatim,
which is why nothing was lost in the migration. To promote one, add a renderer,
convert the block in the JSON, and run `npm run verify` — the data-key assertion
will tell you if you dropped a field.

Two places to put the renderer. A widget every blueprint could use goes in
`BLOCKS` in `src/ui/steps.js`. One that only a single page can render — because
it reads that page's data — is passed as the third argument to `renderSteps()`,
which merges page renderers over `BLOCKS`; that keeps the shared module from
importing a page's data. `short.js` does this for `beatviz` and `festgrid`.

Finish the conversion. Adding the renderer while leaving the `raw` block in the
JSON means the page builds the static markup, throws it away and replaces it —
two representations of one thing, and in the short film's case 5.2KB shipped to
be discarded.

**Change the look** → do NOT edit `modules.css` to make it darker, rounder or
denser. Write a skin: one file in `src/styles/skins/` setting the `--sk-*`
variables in `_contract.css`, and it appears in the Appearance menu on all five
pages with no other edit. Edit `modules.css` only to change the *language* —
what objects exist and how they are arranged — and when you do, every shape you
add must be a variable, or you have quietly made it unskinnable.

**Change the palette** → `tokens.css`, under `[data-theme]`. That is the other
axis; see invariant 7.

**Re-run extraction** → `npm run extract` reads `legacy/`, rewrites `src/data`,
self-checks coverage, and fixes the old page filenames. Safe to re-run; it is
deterministic (same input, byte-identical output).

## Open items

In rough priority order. The reasoning behind the ordering is in the revamp plan.

1. **Rename the storage keys** off `arunak_` with a migration. Blocked on a
   product name. Do it before more people have data, not after.
2. **Close the chain** — scene → shot → stripboard → day-out-of-days → call
   sheet. The single feature that would make this worth switching to. It needs a
   real scene model (INT/EXT, D/N, location, cast IDs, eighths) that the scene
   list, shot list, schedule and budget all read from; today they are four
   islands on the same page.
3. **AI, bring-your-own-key.** Key in `localStorage`, per-device, never synced.
   Anthropic's browser calls need `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access`.
   The value is in-place work (dialogue passes, beat critique) using the
   blueprint as context — not a chat box.
4. **Script import** (`.fountain`, `.fdx`) and a proper screenplay PDF. Export
   exists; import does not, so the tool can't be used on a project in flight.
5. **Finish collaboration.** The comments API in `src/lib/cloud.js` is fully
   written — threads, suggestions, accept/reject — with no UI attached.
   Audit Supabase row-level security before real strangers hold share links.
6. **Refresh the Chennai rates** (currently 2024-25, shown with that date) and
   turn the festival list into a submission tracker.
7. First-run experience: a new user currently lands on a blocking "new project"
   modal in front of a wall of 24 steps.

## Things that are deliberate, not oversights

- `radius: 2px`. The studio is printed matter, not iOS.
- Sepia is a real third theme for long writing sessions, not a dark variant.
- Semantic colours (ok / warn / danger) are never one of the three volume hues.
- Supabase and `pptxgenjs` are lazy chunks; they must stay out of first paint.
- `legacy/` is committed on purpose — now as the historical record and as the
  input `npm run extract` parses, not as the verification oracle.
